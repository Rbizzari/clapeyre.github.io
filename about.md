Born in Toulouse France, brought up there and in Berkeley, CA, I have always
been passionate about physics. I completed a scientific baccalaureate, and went
in engineering school where I was able to participate in a student race car
project. This confirmed my taste for technological challenges, from
computer-aided design and optimisation to production and quality control. I
then decided to turn to aerospace engineering, and completed my masters in this
field. I then found an opportunity for a Ph.D. in numerical combustion physics,
which I defended in 2015.

During the course of these studies, I have extensively used and learned about
computer-aided design, low and high level coding including for High Performance
Computing applications.
