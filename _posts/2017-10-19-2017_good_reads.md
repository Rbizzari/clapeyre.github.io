## Deep Learning

This recent but already reference textbook for Deep Learning is an
excellent introduction (and then some) to the concept of this emerging
field. It gets *very* technical but the first chapters explain well the
context and revisit the concepts needed to understand what this new
approach is, and how it relates to previous machine learning endeavors.

## The Second Machine Age

What will the rise of AI imply for our social model? Probably chaos...
This is an interesting overview of the economical sectors that will be
hurt first by the AI wave, but also by those less obvious. It ultimately
shows that we must rethink our economy if we expect it to adapt to this
new world order.

## The End of Alchemy

This "non-memoir" from the former governor of the Bank of England is
a unique insider take on the 2008 financial crisis, and the state of the
world economy today. While this is a view of the banking system by someone
who helped it stay afloat an thrive, it offers some excellent insights on
how the system as a whole - and not just the banking system - was geared
towards the crisis, and why it hasn't yet changed enough to ensure that it
won't happen again. It also offers ideas as to how to push the system
towards a safer state.

## Life 3.0

In the midst of a huge hype on AI, this book by MIT cosmologist Max
Tegmark approaches various aspects that we may be concerned about. Whether
in the short, medium or very long term, AI will have many impacts on our
lives, and ultimately on mankind. While many scenarios can be imagined and
no one knows which will prevail, this book opens the discussion on which
scenarios we would prefer, and what we should do to make them happen.

## The Annotated Turing

The famous paper of Alan Turing [On Computable Numbers, with an
Application to the Entscheidungsproblem](
http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/canon/turing-compnum.pdf) is
often considered to be the foundational paper for what we call
a *computer* today. However, it can be very hard to read without
appropriate the mathematical background or the historical context. This
book offers both, and it is well written. I just need to finish it...

## Thinking in Systems

Systems everywhere! Lots of great examples to introduce the concept of
systems modelling. Starts very simple and builds systems 101 concepts.
I think anyone can see the insights that this approach offers to many real
world issues we are concerned about every day.

## Révolution

Why not learn a bit about our new president? Interesting read, as he takes
the time here to say some things he cannot in the public sphere. Beyond
his personal life, his vision for the future of politics and the role of
the state in France is enlightening.
