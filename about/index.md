Hi, I'm Corentin Lapeyre. Born in Toulouse France, brought up between
France and Berkeley, CA, I have always been passionate about physics.
After a scientific baccalaureate, I went to engineering school, and really
loved it! I was lucky to participate in a [student race car
project](http://www.epsa-team.com/les-vehicules/symbioz). This confirmed
my taste for technological challenges, from computer-aided design and
optimisation to production and quality control.  I then decided to turn to
aerospace engineering, and completed my masters in this field. After
6 months at Purdue University, I found an opportunity for a Ph.D. in
numerical combustion physics in France, and I decided to go back.
I defended my Ph.D. in September of 2015, and am now shifting towards
artificial intelligence and how recent advances can apply to physics,
specifically numerical fluid dynamics and combustion.

During the course of my studies, I have extensively used and learned about
computer-aided design, as well as low and high level coding for scientific
applications.  I have worked with Fortran/MPI for High Performance
Computing applications, but have now become more of
a [Python](https://www.python.org/) evangelist. I am a daily user of
[git](https://git-scm.com/), [vim](http://www.vim.org/) and
[LaTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) on Mac OS and Unix platforms.  I strongly
believe that the scientific world is often too far from modern programming
tools, and would greatly benefit from it.
